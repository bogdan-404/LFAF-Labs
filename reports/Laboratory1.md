## Grammar

Variant 30:

VN={S, B, C, D},
VT={a, b, c},
P={
S → aB  
 B → bS  
 B → aC  
 B → c  
 C → bD  
 D → c  
 D → aC
}

This grammar is of type 2 according to Chomsky classification, because all the production rules have a single non-terminal value on the left, and can generate any combination of terminal/non-terminal symbols on the right.
